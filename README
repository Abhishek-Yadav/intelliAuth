Purpose:

IntelliAuth is an intelligent authentication scheme for web applications that is based on utilizing browser fingerprints to uniquely classify an authorized user from a fraudulent one.

Log:

IntelliAuth is a "Work in progress", right now I am able to classify data only on the basis of static values assignment to various IntelliAuth datafields.
We plan to upgrade the system by auto-classification of dataset values by using learning approach rather than plain static assignments.

There are few good client side fingerprinting solutions available of which I found [carlo-jquery-browser-fingerprint] (https://github.com/carlo/jquery-browser-fingerprint) to be relatively simple and easy to understand, which I have also drawn ispiration from for my fingerprinting solution.

IntelliAuth.js v1 consists of data values obtained from javascript navigator object and other js objects supported by most of the browsers. Ref : [MDN] (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/window.navigator)

!IMP:

IntelliAuth consisits of 2 major modules, first the browser fingerprinting module (IntelliAuth.js) and second classification module written in C# and operates upon Oracle 11gXE RDB.
